> Docker image based on Ubuntu 18.04 containing the minimum amount of utilities needed to run [AMPL](http://ampl.com/) models and Python 3.6 programs.

## How to Install

You can get this image from Docker Hub:

`docker pull jkomyno/ampl-python`

You can also build it locally from this repository:

- `git clone git@github.com:jkomyno/ampl-python-docker.git`
- `cd ampl-python-docker`
- `docker build -t jkomyno/ampl-python .`

## Note on AMPL

Since AMPL is a commercial product, the `jkomyno/ampl-python` Docker image only incluees the free demo of AMPL by default.
It's automatically downloaded from [ampl.com](http://ampl.com/), and contains many commercial optimization solvers, like
CPLEX and BARON.

## Customization

In case you need it, you can build your own custom Docker image based on this one.
A number of dynamic build arguments are available:

* **UBUNTU** [18.04]: change it if you'd rather use a different version of Ubuntu;
* **PYTHON** [3.6]: change it if you'd rather use a different version of Python;
* **AMPL** [[Free demo for Linux 64bit](http://ampl.com/demo/ampl.linux64.tgz)]: change it if you wish to use another AMPL version available in the Docker context.

For instance, if you have a custom AMPL archive named `ampl.tgz` in the current folder and you wish to configure the Docker image to use it,
you can run the following:

`docker build --build-args AMPL=ampl.tgz -t ampl-python-custom .`
